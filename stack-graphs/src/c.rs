// Forward partial path stitching

/// Implements a phased forward partial path stitching algorithm.
///
/// Our overall goal is to start with a set of _seed_ partial paths, and to repeatedly extend each
/// partial path by concatenating another, compatible partial path onto the end of it.  (If there
/// are multiple compatible partial paths, we concatenate each of them separately, resulting in
/// more than one extension for the current path.)
///
/// We perform this processing in _phases_.  At the start of each phase, we have a _current set_ of
/// partial paths that need to be processed.  As we extend those partial paths, we add the
/// extensions to the set of partial paths to process in the _next_ phase.  Phases are processed
/// one at a time, each time you invoke `sg_forward_partial_path_stitcher_process_next_phase`.
///
/// After each phase has completed, the `previous_phase_paths` and `previous_phase_paths_length`
/// fields give you all of the partial paths that were discovered during that phase.  That gives
/// you a chance to add to the `sg_partial_path_database` all of the other partial paths that we
/// might need to extend those partial paths with before invoking the next phase.
