//! Partial paths can be "stitched together" to produce name-binding paths.
//!
//! The "path stitching" algorithm defined in this module is how we take a collection of [partial
//! paths][] and use them to build up name-binding paths.  Our conjecture is that by building paths
//! this way, we can precompute a useful amount of work at _index time_ (when we construct the
//! partial paths), to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done at _query time_ (when those
//! partial paths are stitched together into paths).
//!
//! Complicating this story is that for large codebases (especially those with many upstream and
//! downstream dependencies), there is a _very_ large set of partial paths available to us.  We
//! want to be able to load those in _lazily_, during the execution of the path-stitching
//! algorithm.
//!
//! The types in this module provide this functionality.  `Database` manages a collection of
//! partial paths that have been loaded into this process from some external data store.  The
//! various `PathStitcher` types implement the path-stitching algorithm in _phases_.  During each
//! phase, we will process a set of (possibly incomplete) paths, looking in the `Database` for the
//! set of partial paths that are compatible with those paths.  It is your responsibility to make
//! sure that the database contains all of possible extensions of the paths that we're going to
//! process in that phase.  For the first phase, you already know which paths you're starting the
//! search from, and must make sure that the database starts out containing the possible extensions
//! of those "seed" paths.  For subsequent phases, you get to see which paths will be processed in
//! the _next_ phase as part of handling the _current_ phase.  This gives you the opporunity to
//! load additional partial paths into the `Database` before allowing the next phase to proceed.

/// partial path by concatenating another, compatible partial path onto the end of it.  (If there
/// are multiple compatible partial paths, we concatenate each of them separately, resulting in
/// more than one extension for the current path.)
///
/// We perform this processing in _phases_.  At the start of each phase, we have a _current set_ of
/// partial paths that need to be processed.  As we extend those partial paths, we add the
/// extensions to the set of partial paths to process in the _next_ phase.  Phases are processed
/// one at a time, each time you invoke the [`process_next_phase`][] method.
